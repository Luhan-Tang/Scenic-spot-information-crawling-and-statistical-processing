# Scenic-spot-information-crawling-and-statistical-processing-of-travel-website
This is my Python course final assignment.
I excelled in a project involving web scraping and data analysis of a major Chinese travel website. This project involved parsing webpages by BeautifulSoup, extracting data, conducting text analysis using jieba, and visualizing word clouds. I also analyzed the quantity of attractions at different provincial levels and created corresponding maps using pyecharts.
